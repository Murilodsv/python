!  module of declarations and initialisation routines for JULES/UM

MODULE jules_mod

  ! Description:
  !   Module containing declarations of JULES-related variables
  !   and initialisation subroutines.
  !
  ! Method:
  !   Module contains declarations of variables needed for
  !   implementation of JULES routines in the UM, and also
  !   subroutines required to initialise these variables.
  !
  !   Since these variables will be in the UM whether JULES routines
  !   are implemented or not, the idea is to collect them here
  !   and then have different versions of this module for different
  !   physics versions. Specifically, the new variables will have
  !   different dimensions when JULES routines are not used.
